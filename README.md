## How to start my application? ## 
1.	Clone my repository into your local device. For example, by:
git clone https://github.com/ShengjunSun/C4C-tech-challenge-2024.git
2.	Open command prompt. Cd into the repository in your local environment. 
3.	Run “npm install” if necessary. 
4.	Run “npm run dev”
5.	Open any browser, go to localhost:3000

## A high-level overview of the application. ## 
Please refer to the file “overview of application.pdf” Bonus features are explained in that file also. 

## Explanation of design decisions. ##
Personally, I believe that a graph illustrates code design better than paragraphs. Thus, please refer to “Software Graph.jpg” in the repository.
In the graph, it explains communication between different components (e.g. frontend and backend) of the application, as well as design decisions. Kind regards. 

## Short reflection of my work: ## 
Honestly speaking, this is the first time that I have developed a web application. Thanks to the previous coding experiences I had in other languages, it was not difficult for me to program the web application. 
The only hardship I faced is the lack of sufficient time. I’m currently taking 2 summer classes, thus failed to find sufficient time for further fine-tune the application or add additional bonus features. 
## If I have more time, I will: ##
-	In a sense that C4C might work with partners from different industries, it will be nice to add into each partner a flag telling which industry that partner belongs to. And, similar as only showing active or inactive partners, allow only showing partners from a specific industry. 
-	I believe that we only wish the entire dashboard to be visible to C4C members. Thus, it would be nice that, for example, upon entering localhost:3000, the user needs to enter “C4C member” (an example password) for seeing the dashboard. Then, if the user is simultaneously an administrator, him/her may enter the admin password for the ability to add additional partners or edit/delete existing partners. 
-	Enable both users and admins to rate or comment on each partner. Only allow admins to delete comment(s) on each partner. 
-	Enable each visitor of the site to choose from dark mode / bright mode.
